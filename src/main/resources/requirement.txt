Please complete the coding exercise and provide the link for this working project.

Prerequisites:

The problem needs to be written in Java language
Any libraries/frameworks can be used
You can use a database of your choice
You can use the following as a practice file: PracticeFile.csv (attached as well)
Requirements:

Create a REST API that takes in a parameter and does the following:
Reads the CSV file from a folder
Add the CSV file headers to a database store
Based on the parameter only store either the odd or even rows in the database
If parameter is not passed in then insert all rows into the database
Return the CSV rows (all, even, or odd rows based on parameter) as a String Array
And unit tests to verify the logic.
